# Chloe's Compiler

Chloe's Compiler is a programming language written in Java that can accept user inputs, do math computations, preform if statements and integer/string comparisons, and preform for loops. 

## Usage

1. How to create a user input variable (ints and Strings) 

input number x
input word y 

(x and y are the variable names, number is a replacement for int, word is a replacement for String)

2. How to do math computations

doMath x = 1 + 1 

(x is the variable name, doMath tells the compiler that an operation is being performed: +, -, *, /, %) 

3a. Comparisons (int)

x == y (x is equal to y)
x < y (x is less than y)
x > y (x is greater than y)

3b. Comparisons (String) 

x.length == y.length
x.length < y.length
x.length > y.length 

4. If statements

iff( x == y ) 

(x and y are the variable names, "iff" is used in place of "if") 

5. For loops 

fLoop( 3 )

(fLoop is used in place of "for", the parameter is the amount of times the loop will run) 

6. Printing

output( x ) 

(output is used in place of "System.out.println()") 

7. Errors 

Errors message: "cannot compile"

8. Commenting

(<> is used in place of //)
